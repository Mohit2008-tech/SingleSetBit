# SingleSetBit
We know that all the number that is the power of 2 is actually contains a single set bit in its binary Representation. That's why this game is called Single Set bit.
It's a clone version of 2024 game. Implemented the logics for the 2024 game through C# and Unity Engine. 
To experinece this game just download the SingleSetBit.exe file and run it on you PC.
After learning Algorithms behind this game, it's have been easier for me to develop some more 
Numbers game, using some crazy Maths logics.
